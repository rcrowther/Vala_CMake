The code is littered with TODO markings. Please look at source for details.

DONE
- Where's Valadoc?


TODO
Auto detect packages :)
Auto detect subfolders?
Some semi-auto position for libraries bindings at least. The prepetition in the CMakeLists.txt file is a lot, and Vala autobuilds from pkg-config after all. 
Mainfile: Link_libs/link_dirs deprecated for target specific verions.
Maybe valac flags could be passed to valadoc?
- Vala update reveals some errors
- Needs a quickstart. Probably published to GitHub. With all commands.
Make the README into a MANUAL.
- Rework the CMake.txt example, and annotate.
- ValaBindingsLocation should work on more architectures. Prime targets are
  -- yum paths (Fedora, CentOS, etc.)
  -- Whatever methods Vala is compiled for Windows (Cygwin?)
- the documentation ain't cmake
- Should the findbinding approach compile with --nostdpkg ?
- Parallel compilation, crosscheck,
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/434
- Should UseVala depend on custom vapi lists?

BACKBURNING
- Wouldn't it be nice if Nemiver could be pre-allocated with Vala source locations (and maybe C files)?



== MAYBEPATH
Draft
No testing.
Features considered, code sketched out. 
May contain intrusive debug code, but should be operative.

Alpha
Only basic testing. May fail on inplace compiling, for example
All features/API subject to change.
May contain debug code, but should be operative.

Beta
Enough testing, even internal, to ensure Alpha behaviour unlikely.
Basic approach is frozen, though features open to change.
May contain debug code, but should be operative.

Release Candidate
Works with source code as expected by a user. Should be tested on yum and maybe cygwin hosts.
Code developed enough for the features unlikly to change.
Debug code should be formalized.

Release
A Release Candidate tested enough, preferably externally, to suggest it will perform with the stated features, and as the user can expect.
