The code is littered with TODO markings. Pleasee loiok at source for details.

DONE
- Where's Valadoc?


TODO
- ValaBindingsLocation should work on more architectures. Prime targets are
  -- yum paths (Fedora, CentOS, etc.)
  -- Whatever methods Vala is compiled for Windows (Cygwin?)
- the documentation ain't cmake
- Parallel compilation, crosscheck,
http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/434
- Should UseVala depend on custom vapi lists?

BACKBURNING
- Wouldn't it be nice if Nemiver could be pre-allocated with Vala source locations (and maybe C files)?
