The code is littered with TODO markings. Pleasee loiok at source for details.

DONE
- Where's Valadoc?


TODO
- Vala update reveals some errors
- Needs a quickstart. Probaly published to GitHub. With all commands.
Make the README into a MANUAL.
- Rework theCMake.txt example, and annotate.
- ValaBindingsLocation should work on more architectures. Prime targets are
  -- yum paths (Fedora, CentOS, etc.)
  -- Whatever methods Vala is compiled for Windows (Cygwin?)
- the documentation ain't cmake
- Should the findbinding approach compile with --nostdpkg ?
- Parallel compilation, crosscheck,

- Should UseVala depend on custom vapi lists?

BACKBURNING
- Wouldn't it be nice if Nemiver could be pre-allocated with Vala source locations (and maybe C files)?
